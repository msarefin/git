git log

git log -n 2

git log --since=2016-08-08

git log --until=2016-08-08

git log --author="sunny"

git diff 

git diff [files]

git diff --staged
git diff --staged

git rm file.ext
git commit -m "deleted the test.txt"

if yourename a file in the file explorer then you must do thefollowing for git  to recognize the changes 

ex: first.txt is renamed to home.txt

git status will show that we deleted first.txt and then created home.txt 

For git to recignize the rename  we have to write a set of commands 
 
 git add home.txt
 git rm first.txt
 
Then when we do git status we will see the following:

renamed first.txt -> home.txt 

alternative way to rename a file is 

git mv second.txt beta.txt

git mv beta.txt first/ --> This will move file to the destination folder
